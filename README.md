# Covid-19

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

# How it spreads

Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.

# About the data

The data is sourced from Johns Hopkins CSSE.

## It changes rapidly

This data changes rapidly, so what’s shown may be out of date. Information about reported cases is also available on the World Health Organization site.

## It doesn’t include all cases

Confirmed cases aren’t all cases. They only include people who tested positive. Testing rules and availability vary by country.
